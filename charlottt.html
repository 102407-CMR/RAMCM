        <p>
            You're the one that never lets me sleep<br>
            To my mind, down to my soul, you touch my lips<br>
            You're the one that I can't wait to see<br>
            With you here by my side, I'm in ecstasy<br>
            I am all alone without you<br>
            My days are dark without a glimpse of you<br>
            Now that you came into my life, I feel complete<br>
            The flowers bloom, my morning shines, and I can see<br>
            Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world<br>
            I feel the warmth inside<br>
            Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins<br>
            I feel the chill inside<br>
            Every time I hear our music play<br>
            Reminds me of the things we've been through<br>
            In my mind, I can't believe it's true<br>
            But in my heart, the reality is you<br>
            I am all alone without you<br>
            My days are dark without a glimpse of you<br>
            But now that you came into my life, I feel complete<br>
            The flowers bloom, my morning shines, and I can see<br>
            Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world<br>
            I feel the warmth inside<br>
            Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins<br>
            I feel the chill inside<br>
            Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world<br>
            I feel the warmth inside<br>
            Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins<br>
            I feel the chill inside<br>
            Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world<br>
            I feel the warmth inside<br>
            Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins<br>
            I feel the chill inside<br>
            Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world<br>
            I feel the warmth inside<br>
            Your love is like the river, flows down through my veins<br>
            I feel the chill inside<br>
            Your love, your love<br>
            Won't you give me your love tonight?<br>
            Your love<br>
